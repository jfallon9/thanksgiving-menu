# Menu for Thanksgiving 2017

For the upcoming Thanksgiving feast I have put together the following document describing the menu, and the proposed recipes we use to bring everything together for a fun and fabulous feast! I've divided it up into 3 sections; entrees, sides and desert. Recipes are listed, and Im thinking of trying out a dry brining method for the turkey breast instead of a traditional wet brine, see the turkey section below for additional details and some links to articles describing the science behind brining, which is quite interesting. The desert section is a bit bare at the moment as I think Martha has many of these recipes lying around the house on paper and such. 

## Entrees

* Turkey Breast. This one I'm torn over whether to try a traditional wet brine or a dry brine. [This article](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/the-food-lab-the-truth-about-brining-turkey-thanksgiving.html) describes the issues with a traditional brine and why a dry brine (basically salt the turkey instead of soaking in water) is better. Im leaning towards the [dry brine method described here](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/quick-and-dirty-guide-to-brining-turkey-chicken-thanksgiving.html) and [this herb butter based roasting recipie](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/11/herb-butter-rubbed-crisp-skinned-butterflied-spatchcock-roast-turkey-thanksgiving-recipe.html)
* Slow Cooked Chicken Legs. Choosing between [Red Wine Braised](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/11/red-wine-braised-turkey-legs.html) or [Garlic Chicken Legs](https://blog.paleohacks.com/slow-cooker-chicken-drumsticks/). The first recipe we would adapt to make in the slow cooker, essentially instead of braising in the oven we would do it in the slow cooker, and I think it sounds better but a bit more involved, which I'm ok with.
* [Mustard-Glazed Pork Tenderloin](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10080-mustard-glazed-pork-tenderloin?utm_source=sharetools&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=website)
